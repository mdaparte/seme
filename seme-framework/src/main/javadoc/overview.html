            The Sequentially Executed Model Evaluation (SeMe -- pronounced "seem") 
            Framework decouples model development
            from I/O development for certain classes of discrete models. 
            The model classes of interest are
            numerical models that are evaluated sequentially for each step along a 
            discrete axis. Because most of these types of models are time-series 
            models, so this document will use time-series models 
            in most examples and descriptions. However, any model that is controlled by
            stepping a parameter along a discrete axis will work with this framework. 
            To do this, the controlling parameter is divided into equal size steps, and 
            the model is evaluated once per step. For unitless parameters, integer 
            steps are used. For time series models, steps are in date/time format. And 
            on other continuous axes, as long as the axis is divided into equal size 
            bins, a step index can be calculated and used (such as depth along a bore 
            hole).
        </p><p>
            Moving back to time-series models, certain models are executed at a 
            fixed rate in real time. The data used in such real time models is 
            generally obtained in some way from physical measurements. For testing
            and development, historical data is usually extracted into a historian 
            database or into data files. Unfortunately, real time data collection is
            hardly standardized â€“ even Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
            systems are incredibly diverse, and frequently involve custom, one-off 
            databases for data collection. Developing models that execute in real time
            is therefore complicated by the need to interface with the database; the
            I/O effort can quickly overwhelm the model development, and resulting models
            can end up
            tied to specific databases or requiring massive rework to move the model to
            a different system. The goal of the SeMe framework is to separate the model 
            and I/O efforts by
            providing a messaging interface that models can use for their input and output
            while leaving the specific 
            I/O drivers for someone else to program (SEP).
        </p><p>
            The controller makes a call to the SeMe Engine 
            for each step, iteratively. Each of these calls runs first all the 
            input tasks, then all the model tasks, and finally all the output 
            tasks. The Java ExecutionService framework is used to run the tasks 
            in thread pools, taking advantage of multiple cores as well as 
            advances in thread management within the Java virtual machine (JVM).
            These concurrency classes are the reason SeMe requires Java 7 or 
            later. The Engine waits for all tasks of a specific type 
            (input, model, or output) to complete before starting the next 
            group.

            The SeMe framework uses the following third-party libraries: 
            <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j">log4j</a>; the example 
            programs also use the following third-party libraries:
            <a href="http://argparse4j.sourceforge.net">argparse4j</a>
            and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/snakeyaml">SnakeYAML</a>.
            The version 5 of the <a href="https://software.sandia.gov/trac/canary">CANARY-EDS</a>
            software uses the SeMe Framework as its API for user-defined inputs and outputs.
